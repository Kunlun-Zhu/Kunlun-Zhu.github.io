Hello! I am **Kunlun Zhu**, a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I am currently co-advised by [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/) at Ulab and [Prof. Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at the [BlenderLab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). Prior to this, I spent two years as a Research Assistant in the Natural Language Processing group at Tsinghua University and as an Algorithm Engineer at ModelBest Inc., working under the guidance of [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://lzy.thunlp.org/). I'm also proud to be a member of [OpenBMB](https://www.openbmb.cn/en/about-us).

I am currently collaborating with Prof. James Zou at Stanford University and was a visiting student there during the summer of 2025.

My research journey has been diverse and enriching. I had the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant for 6 months at the Mila Quebec AI Institute's Graph Team, collaborating with [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). Additionally, I spent a year as a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, working alongside [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/). More details about my experience can be found at [CV](https://github.com/Kunlun-Zhu/Kunlun-Zhu/blob/main/Kunlun_Zhu_Resume_0914.pdf). 

I'm always eager to expand my research horizons! If you're a master's or undergraduate student seeking research experience, or a PhD student interested in collaboration, I'd be delighted to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me at <kunlunz2@illinois.edu> to explore potential research opportunities together.

ðŸŽ† **News**

- **Sep 2025** â€“ Our paper on *AI Scientist Safety* has been officially accepted at *Nature Communications*.  
- **Aug 2025** â€“ Our paper *SafeScientist* has been accepted at the *EMNLP 2025 Main Conference*.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are centered around large language models (LLMs) and their applications. I'm particularly fascinated by:

- Post-training for agent: Reinforcement Learning, Agent tuning
- Agentic System including:
  - Tool learning and Planning
  - Embodied Agents
  - Multi-agent systems
- Agents for scientific research

I'm excited about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs and exploring how they can be leveraged to solve complex problems across various domains.
